# Object-Oriented Design (programing) Course - AGH UST 🎓👨‍💻

Welcome to the **Object-Oriented Design** course at AGH University of Science and Technology! This course is designed to dive deep into the principles of object-oriented programming and design, preparing you for the challenges of modern software development. 🚀📚

## Course Overview 📖

In this course, we'll cover everything from the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP) to advanced design patterns. You'll learn how to think in objects, design reusable and maintainable classes, and apply design patterns to solve common software design problems. 🧠💡

## Labs 🧪🖥️

Our lab sessions are where theory meets practice. You'll get hands-on experience implementing OOP principles and design patterns in real-world scenarios. Expect to code, refactor, and debug - all while receiving immediate feedback from our experienced instructors. 🛠️🔍

## Course Objectives 🎯

- Understand the core principles of object-oriented programming and design.
- Apply OOP concepts to design robust, reusable, and maintainable software.
- Master the use of design patterns to solve common software design challenges.
- Develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills in a software development context.

## Tools and Technologies 🛠️💻

Throughout the course, we'll be using a variety of tools and technologies, including:

- **Java**: Our primary programming language for illustrating OOP concepts.
- **UML**: For designing and visualizing software architectures.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.
- **IDEs**: Such as IntelliJ IDEA and Visual Studio Code.
